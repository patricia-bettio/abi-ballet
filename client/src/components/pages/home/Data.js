    "Hi! I'm Rosa Gomes and have worked as a ballet teacher for the last 38 years, the last 6 in Curitiba being hired by the City Hall. I taught many underpriviledged children and teens and we made presentations, even winning prizes. Now it's time to open my own studio to reach more children.",

    "The monthly fee for a student with the city Hall is 100dkk, still many cannot afford, some even drop the course depending on how the family situation goes.Today I want to start a project where I am fully dedicated to reach even more boys and girls in vulnerability.",

    "With a goal of 150 students, half of them will contribute with 60, 70 or 90 reais per month (basic, intermediate and advanced level). The other half will be dedicated to scholarship students who are unable to contribute and will study for free.",

    "My intention is to raise a year's rent for a space in a peripheral neighborhood where many children and teens in the region have easy access, plus a small value for the young talents who cannot afford transportantion nor a meal (students granted the scholarship will go to class after school thus need to pay transportation to the studio and a meal).",
  description5:
    "Also, the value of the contribution collected monthly by the students who pay will be reversed in the purchase of mirrors, bar, and materials needed for class. Donations will be received via the Fopundation I have registered under my name (RegN.) through the Vakinha link, and the administrative report will be uploaded to this wesite to ensure transparency.",
